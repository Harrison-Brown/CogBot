# CogBot
Basic Discord bot written in Python. Contains framework for cog use to keep variables localized and scripts organized.

`/ExampleCogs` folder contains several cogs and methods that can be used to piece together working bot. Cogs are automatically imported when moved from `/ExampleCogs` to `/cogs`

`config.py` needs to be edited for bot to work. Grab token from https://discord.com/developers and replace string within `config.py`
